# Notes Management App

My this project is a **full-stack application** built with **React** as ( frontend) and **Django REST Framework** as (backend). The app allows users to register, log in, create, view, and delete notes. The application also implements JWT-based authentication and authorization.

- **User Authentication:**
  - Register new users.
  - Login using username and password.
  - Logout functionality.

- **Notes Management:**
  - Create, view, and delete personal notes.
  - Notes are tied to the authenticated user.

- **Security:**
